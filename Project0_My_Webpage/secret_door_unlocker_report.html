<h1>Project Report</h1>

<h3>Introduction and Background</h3>
<p> 
  <p>
    The goal of this project was to design and fabricate a device that could unlock a door after receiving a specific secret knock sequence. To establish portability, a mountable design was selected and an Arduino was used to control the entire system. In the best case scenario, the motor used to handle the door lever would be light as well, requiring minimal power and thus providing maximum portability; unfortunately, the motor chosen was too large and powerful, requiring an external power supply and damaging the design's portability.
  </p>
  <p>
    An Arduino 101 was utilized with an on-board accelerometer to detect door knocks, especially with the help of a library (CurieIMU) provided by the board. To ensure accurate knock detections, the proper debouncing had to be calibrated by testing different debouncing times (minimum time interval between consecutive knocks to reduce effects of extra vibrations, etc.); to ensure accurate knock comparisons with the saved secret knock sequence, times between knocks were read and mapped to a set range for easy comparison (see code for more detail). An H-bridge chip was connected to the system to allow both clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the motor so that the door handle could be both opened and closed. Other small components, such as LEDs for success and failure notification and a button to indicate saving a new knock sequence, were added to the design as well, all of which were implemented on a breadboard; in the future, it can be beneficial to solder all of the components onto a perfboard for compactness and ease of mounting on the physical frame used.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the conclusion of the final project, multiple designs were cycled and a version of the above implementation, with a PVC pipe based door frame, was utilized successfully.
  </p>
</p>

<h3>Testing Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      Multiple designs were attempted and discarded in the design iteration process, and the final product utilized a relatively simpler and straightforward circuit that successfully met (most of) the initial project goals. Throughout the process, two main avenues of issues existed; software (Arduino code), and hardware (circuit, electrical components, etc.), of which the hardware issues nearly consistently posed more confounding problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic software design was completed earlier in the process, further developing gradually as general optimizations, code restructures, and debouncing times were accrued. Specifically:
      <ul>
        <li>Minimum thresholds for accelerometer shock/knock detection were experimentally determined by placing the Arduino 101 on a flat hard surface (commonly a desk) and knocking on the surface from different distances and with varying intensities.</li>
        <li>Debouncing time (minimum times between knocks) was determined, also experimentally, by tweaking the time (higher to block more extraneous "noise", and lower to increase sensitivity to higher frequency knocks) for each surface used such that only all the knocks delivered are consistently reflected in the Arduino's knock input. In the future, it would be recommended to plot accelerometer values during knocks to determine, exactly, how much debouncing time is needed.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardware provided its own set of problems, generally following the trend of progress and debugging as detailed below:
      <ul>
        <li>A single NPN transistor was first utilized to rotate the motor one way. After successful testing (switching the transistor on and off with the Arduino), a two transistor design was attempted to allow rotation of the motor in both ways.</li>
        <li>A PNP transistor along was added to the single NPN transistor setup to rotate the motor in both directions. This originally failed with a single voltage source since it was discovered (with a digital multimeter, or DMM) that a relatively negative voltage was not being applied to the base of the PNP, and thus opposite motion was not possible. Furthermore, the negative voltage source was required to connect to the PNP circuit that would turn the motor in the opposite direction. Thus, two voltage sources were connected in series and the positive of one was connected to the negative of another to simulate ground and the respective positive and negative voltages.
        </li>
        <li>To account for the lack of a negative output from the Arduino to trigger the PNP transistor, an operational amplifier (opamp) was utilized to invert the positive voltage signal output from the Arduino to direct to the PNP base. On some cases, this approach would work; however, it became evident that a short-circuit was occurring (the PNP was not turned completely off appropriately) when the transistors started smoking and the DMM was used to determine non-zero voltages being applied by the PNP at incorrect times. This failed circuit is shown in Figure 1 below.</li>
        <li>At this point, the H-bridge chip was ordered and successfully used to control motor direction. This circuit was simply tested with a DMM checking voltage across the H-bridge outputs in response to the input voltages applied by the Arduino denoting motor direction. The schematic for this circuit is included below in Figure 2.</li>

        </figure>
        <ul>
          <li>Finally, an H-bridge was used in order to rotate the motor both ways. One signal input (1A) of the H-bridge was connected with the digital output of the Arduino and another signal input (2A) of the H-bridge with another digital output of the Arduino.</li>
          <li>
            The two signal outputs of the H-bridge (1Y and 2Y) were connected to the motor. 1Y rotated the motor in clockwise direction and 2Y rotated the motor in anticlockwise direction to achieve the goal of unlocking and locking the door. This way final circuit was set-up as shown in Figure 2.
          </li>

      </ul>
    </p>

  <h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
    <p>
      The required current necessary to rotate our high powered motor was generated successfully. The external power supply came to good use to provide +V to power the motor. The motor started to rotate at 6V and drew about 0.7A and the H-bridge was successfully able to rotate the motor in both directions for the set time of 15 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>Then the arduino was mounted, circuit board and the motor on the PVC pipes with the save button on top and our final mount looked the one shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.

    <p>The clamp attached to the lead screw of the motor was able to push the door handle down and unlock the door with ease.
    </p>
<h3>Conclusion and Future Work</h3>
  <p>The design worked successfully as it was able to both unlock and lock the door with ease. It however did need an external power supply since our motor required high current. It could have used a lower powered motor and attached it to an external battery that could have been mounted with the motor on our setup. That way, the design would have been more easily portable.
  </p>
  <p>If we had more time, we would have liked to add an additional layer of security to our model by verifying the knocker identity to the arduino with the knocker's phone by using the bluetooth sensor of the arduino and smartphone. We would have connected our phones bluetooth to the arduino so that the Arduino would have been able to detect the presence of the real owner's phone since a knock code security can be compromised.
